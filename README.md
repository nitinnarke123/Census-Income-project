# Census-Income-project
This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling project based on the Census Income dataset. 
The main objective of this project is to gain insights from the Census Income data and create predictive models using classification machine learning algorithms.
The primary algorithms explored include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and more.

Introduction
The Census Income dataset is a valuable resource for understanding various factors that contribute to income levels.
This project aims to perform a detailed analysis of the dataset, uncovering meaningful insights and patterns. 
Furthermore, it dives into predictive analytics by building and comparing classification models to predict income levels based on various features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase of this project involves a thorough exploration of the Census Income dataset. 
Key steps include data preprocessing, feature analysis, data visualization, and statistical summaries. This helps in understanding the distribution of various attributes, 
identifying correlations.

Predictive Modeling
The predictive modeling phase focuses on utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict income levels based on the features present in the dataset. 
The following classification algorithms are implemented and compared:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
The models are trained, validated, and evaluated using appropriate metrics to ensure reliable performance.
